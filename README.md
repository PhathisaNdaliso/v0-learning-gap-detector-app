### AI-Driven Software for Educational Equity 🚀

The **Learning Gap Detector** is a targeted AI prototype built for the EdTech sector to identify and address educational disparities through data-driven analysis. By bridging the gap between raw student data and actionable teacher insights, this tool aims to ensure personalized and equitable educational outcomes for the South African community.



## 🔍 The Problem
In many educational settings, identifying exactly where a student is struggling can take weeks of manual assessment. This "gap" often widens before intervention can occur, leading to long-term educational disparities.

## 💡 The Solution
This software acts as a "diagnostic engine" for educators. It processes assessment data to highlight specific areas where student performance deviates from the curriculum standard, allowing for immediate, data-backed intervention.
